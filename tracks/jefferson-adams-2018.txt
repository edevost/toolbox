Jefferson and Adams on June 22 2018. I started at 8 AM and went up the Caps
Ridge Trail, a very beautiful and quite demanding way to go up Mount Jefferson.
Views were awesome all the way up. I then followed the Gulfside Trail to get to
Adams were I reached the top by noon. Lots of bugs and even a squirrel visited
me while I was appreciating the magnificent view. A squirrel ? Where do you
guys get your food from in this desert of rocks ? Crazy beasts. On my way back I
decided to go for a loop, using The Cornice to reach Castle Trail which would
bring me to The Link. That was a great decision as Castle Trail was spectacular,
often walking along high cliffs, with great views on mount Adams all the way.
As I engaged on The Link, I was getting tired and the trail seems to me like
very lightly used (this portion at least), cluttered and sometimes a bit
difficult to walk. But I was glad it existed, as it allowed me to complete one
of the greatest loop I have come to make in the White Mountains.
